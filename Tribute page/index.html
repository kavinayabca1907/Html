            <p id="content">The patriotism of Indian Nationalist Subhash Chandra Bose has left a lasting impression on many Indians. 
            He is well-known for founding the organization “Azad Hind Fauj,” and his slogan is “Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Azadi
             Dunga.” The burn injuries he sustained in a plane crash caused Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose to pass away on August 18, 1945, 
            at a hospital in Taiwan. On January 23, 1897, he was born in Cuttack, Orissa.<br>
            
            The most well-known liberation fighter, Subhash Chandra Bose possessed exceptional leadership qualities and was a charismatic 
            orator. His slogans include “Delhi Chalo,” “tum mujhe khoon do,” and “main tumhe azadi dunga.”He established Azad Hind Fauj
             and made numerous contributions to the fight for India’s independence.He is renowned for his socialist policies as well as
              for the forceful tactics he utilized to win independence.</p><br>
            
           <li><h3><b>His Early Life & Family</b></h3></li>
           <p id="content"> The son of Prabhavati Dutt Bose and Janakinath Bose, Subhash Chandra Bose was born in Cuttack, Orissa, on 
            January 23, 1897.His father had the title of “Rai Bahadur” and was a well-known lawyer in Cuttack. Like his siblings, 
            he attended the Protestant European School in Cuttack, which is now Stewart High School.He completed his undergraduate studies
             at Presidency College.<br>
            
            After reading their writings at the age of 16, Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna’s teachings had an impact on him. 
            Then, in order to prepare for the Indian Civil Service, his parents sent him to the University of Cambridge in England.
            In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after hearing of the nationalist turmoil in India, 
            he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India.</p><br>
            
            <li><h3><b>His Ideology</b></h3></li>
            <p id="content">Bhagavad Gita had an impact on him, and he saw it as a source of inspiration for the fight against the British.
            From a young age, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was highly affected by the Universalist and nationalistic ideas of Swami Vivekanand.<br>
            
            He was drawn to the ideas of socialism and communism when he was a member of the Congress party. However, he thought it would
             succeed in India if National Socialism and Communism were to be combined. He favoured gender equality, secularism, and other
             liberal ideologies, but he didn’t think democracy was ideal for India.</p>
