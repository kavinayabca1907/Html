        <p>(1) Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version
             of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed 
             primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones 
             and tablets.<br>(2) Android is developed by a consortium of developers 
             known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely used 
             version is primarily developed by Google. <br>(3) It was unveiled in 
             November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC 
             Dream, being launched in September 2008.<br>(4) At its core, the operating 
             system is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is free 
             and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache 
             License. <br>(5) However most devices run on the proprietary Android version 
             developed by Google, which ship with additional proprietary closed-source 
             software pre-installed, most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS) 
             which includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution 
             platform Google Play, and the associated Google Play Services development 
             platform. </p>

        <p>(1) HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.<br> (2) It is used to design web pages using
             a markup language.<br>(3) HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
             Hypertext defines the link between web pages.<br> (4) A markup language is used to define
              the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.<br> This 
              language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine 
              can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.<br> (5) Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) 
              are human-readable.The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be 
              done on the text. </p>

        <p>(1) Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language 
            intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you 
            to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this 
            independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.<br> (2) It describes how a webpage 
            should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you 
            can make your website look however you want.<br> (3) CSS lets developers and designers define 
            how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.These CSS style 
            rules would then apply to all header and paragraph text wherever they appeared in the 
            HTML document, without you having to add style instructions in the HTML document each time. 
            CSS is also a powerful tool for arranging website content.<br> (4) By giving size, color, and 
             other properties to HTML elements, you can use CSS to create content boxes that structure 
             and style the layout of a webpage.</p>

        <p>Java is an object-oriented, class-based programming language. The language is 
            designed to have as few dependencies implementations as possible. The intention 
            of using this language is to give relief to the developers from writing codes 
            for every platform. The term WORA, write once and run everywhere is often associated 
            with this language. It means whenever we compile a Java code, we get the byte 
            code (.class file), and that can be executed (without compiling it again) on 
            different platforms provided they support Java. In the year 1995, Java language was 
            developed. It is mainly used to develop web, desktop, and mobile devices. The Java 
            language is known for its robustness, security, and simplicity features. That is designed 
            to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.The Java language has a very interesting 
            history. Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and Jame Gosling, known as the Green team, 
            started the development of Java in the year 1991. These people were the engineers at 
            Sun Microsystems. In 1996, the first public implementation was released as Java 1.0. 
            The compiler of Java 1.0 was rewritten by Arthur Van Hoff to comply strictly with its 
            specification. With the introduction of Java 2, the new versions have multiple different 
            configurations that have been built for the various platforms.</p>

        <p>Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language. There are no type declarations 
            of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short and 
            flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code. Python tracks the 
            types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.Python source 
            files use the ".py" extension and are called "modules." With a Python module hello.py, the easiest 
            way to run it is with the shell command "python hello.py Alice" which calls the Python interpreter 
            to execute the code in hello.py, passing it the command line argument "Alice".The outermost statements 
            in a Python file, or "module", do its one-time setup — those statements run from top to bottom the 
            first time the module is imported somewhere, setting up its variables and functions. A Python module 
            can be run directly — as above python3 hello.py Bob — or it can be imported and used by some other 
            module. When a Python file is run directly, the special variable "__name__" is set to "__main__".</p>

        <p>A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more 
            distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds. Other 
            kinds of data stores can also be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory 
            but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of systems. Nowadays, we use 
            relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage huge volume of data. This is called 
            relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established 
            using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.</p>
